### Version 23.1.0

**AI panel update**
- Prompt Strength slider in both modes is affecting the power of the text prompt.
- When "Magic Prompt" is turned on your text prompt will be automatically improved with added words in order to produce better images.
- Imagination slider in "Reimagine" mode controls how much prompt is used against the input image. 0% means image wouldn't be modified at all and 100% would be same as using "Create" mode.

**Other**
- Tweaks and fixes
- What's new modal ;)
